- [ ] Lowest heartrate
- [ ] Highest heartrate
- [ ] Calmest hour

Ideas for improvement of current functionality:

- [ ] Ensure syncing
  - [ ] Forcing a weekly sync
- [ ] Trigger a new sync (image-tracker?)
- [x] Missing days? (one day missing? did not sync fitbit for two days?)
- [ ] Possible to sync with other device than the app in the smartphone?
- [/] Create a class out of the main program
- [/] Modes of update, create, modify, replace?
